## About this repository

> First off, I won't be uploading the entire project to GitHub because there
> are third-party libraries that I can't redistribute (yet). Instead I'll be
> uploading the pieces that I know for sure are free and clear. Over time I'll
> add dependencies as I secure permission from the authors.
>
> That means people won't be able to compile something that, you know, runs.
> They won't even be able to supply the missing dependencies from a third party
> because in most cases I've modified the middleware I'm using. They'll just be
> able to look at pieces. Does this break some kind of GitHub code? Are
> repositories for projects expected to be complete? I dunno.
